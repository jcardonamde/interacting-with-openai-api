# Interacting-with-openai-api

This repository was created to put into practice learning how to use the OpenAI API to develop a chatbot with its own identity and customize it with fine-tuning so that it acquires the identity of a company.

Integration with other chat applications such as Telegram was also done and a bot, called PlatziBot, was created, which acts as an AI-powered assistant that enhances the Platzi community experience, which is used to recommend technology learning courses.
